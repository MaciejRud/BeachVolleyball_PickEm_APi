# **PICKem Volleyball Prediction API (Core Version)**

The PICKem Volleyball Prediction API is designed as the core backend for a volleyball prediction game. It enables administrators to set up tournaments, events, and questions and allows users to participate by answering questions to earn points based on the accuracy of their predictions. This API is the foundational version, structured for further expansion in features and functionality.

## **Features**

- **User Predictions**: Users can submit answers to events and have their scores calculated once a tournament is finalized.
- **Score Calculation and Ranking**: After tournament finalization, answers are scored, and user rankings are generated.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication, with support for user roles to differentiate between admin and regular users.

## **Technologies**

- **Framework**: FastAPI for RESTful API design
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM for managing relational data
- **Auth**: JWT-based authentication with OAuth2PasswordBearer flow

- **Team**: Represents teams participating in tournaments, consisting of player names and unique identifiers. Teams can participate in multiple tournaments.

- **Event**: Defines questions related to tournaments, including question types, texts, correct solutions, and point values associated with each event. Each event can have multiple user answers.

- **UserAnswer**: Captures usersâ€™ responses to event questions, linking them to user and event identifiers, along with points scored for the response.

### **Protected Endpoints**

Certain endpoints are protected based on user roles:

- **Authenticated User Endpoints**:
  - Submitting answers to events.
  - Retrieving available events and teams.

- **Authenticated Superuser (Admin) Endpoints**:
  - Creating tournaments and events.
  - Setting solutions for events.
  - Finalizing tournaments and calculating rankings.

This core API offers scalable RESTful endpoints, serving as a robust base to introduce advanced features for a complete and interactive user experience.
